It was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 6, 2017, followed by a Microsoft Windows version the following month.[1][2] The game was published by Activision until early 2019, when Bungie acquired the publishing rights to the franchise. It is the sequel to 2014's Destiny and its subsequent expansions. Set in a 'mythic science fiction' world, the game features a multiplayer 'shared-world' environment with elements of role-playing games. Like the original, activities in Destiny 2 are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player 'strikes' and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each planet and features public events as well as new activities not featured in the original. These new activities have an emphasis on exploration of the planets and interactions with non-player characters (NPCs); the original Destiny only featured NPCs in social spaces. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.","release":"1 Oct, 2019","publisher":"Bungie","metacritic":83,"price":34.99,"pic":"assets/gamepic/destiny2.jpg"},{"id":7,"title":"Steep™","type":"Sports","short":"Ride a massive open world across the Alps, where the powder is always fresh and the run never ends.
